# Tooling

This is a list of tooling I've found useful (OS X-focused).

* iTerm2
  * oh-my-zsh
    * [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
  * Source Code Pro, [Input](http://input.fontbureau.com/), and/or [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
  * iterm2colorschemes.com
    * Alternatively: I've uploaded dark and light `.itermcolors` to this repo for quick & easy setup
* Sketch
* Pixelmator
* Postman
