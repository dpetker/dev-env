  - [customizations](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf/)

  - The site has links to theme variants for iTerm, VSCode, etc.
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) - Window resizing app for Mac

## Windows

For Windows-based development, [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) does a great job in creating a Linux environment to work from.

From this site there's lots of docs for setting up certain types of development environments in WSL (for example, [web development with Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/web-frameworks)).
